## 💡 Recommendations
- Several security concerns are noted, including hardcoded API keys and credentials, which pose significant risks. Proper management of sensitive data through environment variables or secure vaults is recommended.
- **Complexity**: Moderate
- The integration of multiple external services and the handling of sensitive data increase the complexity. However, the use of well-documented APIs and cloud services helps manage this complexity.
- . **Security Enhancements**:
- Store all sensitive credentials, such as API keys and AWS credentials, in environment variables or a secure secrets manager to prevent unauthorized access.
- Review and tighten S3 bucket policies and IAM roles to ensure that only authorized entities have access to sensitive data.
- . **Scalability Improvements**:
- Implement parallel processing for message handling to reduce bottlenecks and improve throughput. Consider using AWS Lambda for scalable, serverless processing.
- Optimize the visibility timeout settings in SQS to balance between processing time and message reprocessing delays.
- . **Operational Efficiency**:
- Conduct a thorough review of the worker processes to ensure efficient resource utilization and minimize latency in document processing and course generation.
- Regularly audit and update the system's dependencies and libraries to mitigate vulnerabilities and improve performance.
- Enhance documentation quality, especially for complex integrations and workflows, to facilitate easier maintenance and onboarding of new team members.
- Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging to track system performance and quickly identify and resolve issues.
