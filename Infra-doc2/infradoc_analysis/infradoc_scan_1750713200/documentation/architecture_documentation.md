# Architecture Documentation

## System Architecture Overview

**Architecture Pattern**: Microservices
**Deployment Model**: Cloud-based
**Host**: ec2-3-143-6-83.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com

## Component Analysis

### Core Services
- @dbus-daemon: Application service
- /usr/sbin/chronyd: Application service
- /usr/sbin/chronyd: Application service
- /usr/lib/polkit-1/polkitd: Application service
- nginx:: Web server and reverse proxy
- /usr/sbin/rsyslogd: Application service
- (sd-pam): Application service
- sshd:: Application service
- -bash: Application service
- sshd:: Application service
- sshd:: Application service
- sshd:: Application service
- ps: Application service

### Application Components
- /usr/bin/python3: Application service
- /usr/bin/python3: Application service
- nginx:: Background task processing
- /opt/learnchain/venv/bin/python: Background task processing
- /opt/learnchain/venv/bin/python: Background task processing

### Infrastructure Services
- @dbus-daemon: System service
- /usr/sbin/chronyd: System service
- /usr/sbin/chronyd: System service
- /usr/sbin/rsyslogd: System service

## Technology Stack

### Programming Languages
- Python: 4 files

### Frameworks and Libraries
- Framework analysis pending

### Infrastructure Components
- Nginx web server
- Chrony time synchronization
- Rsyslog system logging

## Service Dependencies


### Service Dependencies

Based on process analysis:
- Web services depend on application workers
- Application workers may depend on external services
- All services depend on system infrastructure (logging, time sync)

**Recommendation**: Map detailed dependencies for better understanding.


## Scalability Assessment

**Current Assessment**: Moderate

### Scalability Factors

- **Current Workers**: 3 background worker processes detected
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Consider load balancing for web services
- **Vertical Scaling**: Monitor resource usage for capacity planning
- **Bottlenecks**: Identify and address performance bottlenecks


## Operational Complexity

**Current Assessment**: Moderate

### Complexity Factors

- **Total Processes**: 18
- **Application Processes**: 5
- **Complexity Drivers**: Multiple services, background workers
- **Management**: Consider orchestration tools for complex deployments


## Architecture Recommendations

- **Optimize Scalability**: Consider implementing auto-scaling for AWS resources and explore containerization (e.g., Docker) to streamline deployments and improve resource utilization.

## Integration Points

- No external integrations detected

## Performance Considerations


### Current Performance Metrics
- **Analysis Duration**: 123.82 seconds
- **Commands Executed**: 58
- **LLM Processing**: 5 calls

### Performance Recommendations
- Implement application performance monitoring
- Set up resource usage alerts
- Regular performance profiling and optimization


## Future Architecture Evolution


### Short-term Evolution (3-6 months)
- Implement containerization for key services
- Set up automated deployment pipelines
- Enhance monitoring and alerting

### Long-term Evolution (6-12 months)
- Consider microservices architecture optimization
- Implement infrastructure as code
- Evaluate cloud-native solutions

### Strategic Evolution (1+ years)
- Full cloud migration assessment
- Advanced orchestration with Kubernetes
- Implementation of service mesh for complex communications
