## Recommendations
- **Current Practices**: Some processes are running as root, which poses a security risk. The principle of least privilege should be enforced to minimize potential vulnerabilities.
- **Recommendations**:
- Review and tighten Nginx configurations, especially SSL/TLS settings, to enhance security.
- Implement input validation and secure coding practices in worker scripts to prevent injection attacks and data breaches.
- Regularly update dependencies and libraries to patch known vulnerabilities.
- **Deployment**: The use of systemd for managing worker processes simplifies deployment but requires careful configuration management.
- **Monitoring and Maintenance**: The distributed nature of the application necessitates robust monitoring solutions to track performance and detect issues across different components.
- **Enhance Security**: Prioritize security improvements by enforcing least privilege, securing configurations, and implementing comprehensive monitoring.
- **Optimize Scalability**: Consider implementing auto-scaling for AWS resources and explore containerization (e.g., Docker) to streamline deployments and improve resource utilization.
- **Simplify Operations**: Invest in centralized logging and monitoring tools to reduce operational overhead and improve incident response times.
