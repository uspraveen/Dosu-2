# Architecture Deep Dive

## System Architecture Overview

**Architecture Pattern**: Unknown
**Deployment Model**: Unknown
**Host**: ec2-3-143-6-83.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com

## Component Analysis

### Core Services
- @dbus-daemon: Application service
- /usr/sbin/chronyd: Application service
- /usr/sbin/chronyd: Application service
- /usr/lib/polkit-1/polkitd: Application service
- nginx:: Web server and reverse proxy
- /usr/sbin/rsyslogd: Application service
- (sd-pam): Application service
- sshd:: Application service
- sshd:: Application service
- ps: Application service

### Application Components
- /usr/bin/python3: Application service
- /usr/bin/python3: Application service
- nginx:: Background task processing
- /opt/learnchain/venv/bin/python: Background task processing
- /opt/learnchain/venv/bin/python: Background task processing

### Infrastructure Services
- Standard Linux infrastructure services

## Technology Stack

### Programming Languages
- Python: 4 files

### Frameworks and Libraries
- Framework analysis pending

### Infrastructure Components
- Nginx web server

## Service Dependencies


### Service Dependencies

Based on process analysis:
- Web services depend on application workers
- Application workers may depend on external services
- All services depend on system infrastructure (logging, time sync)

**Recommendation**: Map detailed dependencies for better understanding.


## Scalability Assessment

**Current Assessment**: Unknown

### Scalability Factors

- **Current Workers**: 3 background worker processes detected
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Consider load balancing for web services
- **Vertical Scaling**: Monitor resource usage for capacity planning
- **Bottlenecks**: Identify and address performance bottlenecks


## Operational Complexity

**Current Assessment**: Unknown

### Complexity Factors

- **Total Processes**: 15
- **Application Processes**: 5
- **Complexity Drivers**: Multiple services, background workers
- **Management**: Consider orchestration tools for complex deployments


## Architecture Recommendations

- Several security concerns are noted, including hardcoded API keys and credentials, which pose a risk of unauthorized access. Proper management of sensitive data through environment variables or secure vaults is recommended.
- **Complexity**: Moderate
- The integration of multiple external services and handling of sensitive data increases operational complexity. However, the use of cloud-native services simplifies some aspects of deployment and scaling.
- . **Enhance Security**:
- Store all sensitive credentials, such as API keys and AWS credentials, in environment variables or a secure secrets manager to prevent unauthorized access.
