- **Security Posture**: Needs assessment

## Security Analysis

Basic security scan completed

## Key Security Findings

- No specific security findings documented

## Priority Recommendations

- Review and implement security best practices

## Process Security Review


### Processes Running as Root
20 processes are running with root privileges:

- PID 1: /usr/lib/systemd/systemd
- PID 2: [kthreadd]
- PID 3: [pool_workqueue_release]
- PID 4: [kworker/R-rcu_g]
